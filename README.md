# Databases-Population

This is a program I wrote for my Databases course at UF. It was used to populate an Oracle
database for a group project. It parses through a CSV with information
about crimes that occurred in the Seattle area in recent years, and adds them to
the database using SQL. The code for the website that my group created using this
database is in the "JavaJettyServer" repository.
